<body style="background-color:burlywood;">
	<p style= "font-type:new times roman;font-color:pink;"> We are a technology women-led, registered community-based organization that equips girls and young women in marginalized communities in Kenya with employable practical skills in STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) with the aim of empowering them economically to have sustainable skills and contribute to the digital economy.  We have pioneered and conducted a broad spectrum of programs on technology for young women in various counties and towns in Kenya. These include; Nakuru, Kisumu, Lamu, Mombasa and Nairobi. Pwani Teknowgalz was started  by passionate young women  in tech Aisha Abubakar, Joan Nabusoba and Ruth Kaveke while studying Technology at Technical University of Mombasa. They were amazed by the low representation of women in technology in their class and were inspired to bridge this gap. So far we have worked with a total number of 6000 young women. The programs we run include STEM CAFE Kenya, Technovation, Codehack, Africa Code Week, Mombasa Girls in STEM and Django Girls.</p>
